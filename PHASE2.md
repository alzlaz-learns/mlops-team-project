# PHASE 2: Enhancing ML Operations with Containerization & Monitoring

## 1. Containerization
- [x] **1.1 Dockerfile**
  - [x] Dockerfile created and tested
  - [x] Instructions for building and running the container
    * build all:
    *   docker compose build
    * build training service:
    *   docker compose build trainer
    * build prediction service:
    *   docker compose build predict
    * run the trainier:
    *   docker compose run --rm trainer
    * run the predict:
    *    docker compose run --rm predict
- [x] **1.2 Environment Consistency**
  - [x] All dependencies included in the container

## 2. Monitoring & Debugging
- [x] **2.1 Debugging Practices**
  - [x] Debugging tools used (e.g., pdb)
    - pdb debugger used
  - [] Example debugging scenarios and solutions

## 3. Profiling & Optimization
- [x] **3.1 Profiling Scripts**
  - [x] cProfile, PyTorch Profiler, or similar used
    - Implemented custom `profile_function` decorator using Python's cProfile
    - Created `PerformanceTracker` class for ML-specific metrics
  - [x] Profiling results and optimizations documented
    - Training performance:
      - Model training time: 0.11 seconds
      - Evaluation time: 0.01 seconds
      - Model saving time: 0.05 seconds
      - Model size: 0.59 MB
    - Prediction performance:
      - Model loading time: 0.60 seconds (one-time cost)
      - Prediction time: 0.015 seconds per prediction
      - Data preprocessing: 0.008 seconds
      - Model inference: 0.006 seconds

## 4. Experiment Management & Tracking
- [ ] **4.1 Experiment Tracking Tools**
  - [ ] MLflow, Weights & Biases, or similar integrated
  - [ ] Logging of metrics, parameters, and models
  - [ ] Instructions for visualizing and comparing runs

## 5. Application & Experiment Logging
- [x] **5.1 Logging Setup**
  - [x] logger and/or rich integrated
    - Custom logging configuration in `logging_config.py`
    - Structured logging with consistent format
  - [x] Example log entries and their meaning
    ```
    INFO: Starting model training process
    INFO: Loading and preprocessing data
    INFO: Data loaded and preprocessed. Shape: (768, 9)
    INFO: Training set size: 614, Test set size: 154
    INFO: Model training completed. Final accuracy: 0.7468
    ```

## 6. Configuration Management
- [x] **6.1 Hydra or Similar**
  - [] Configuration files created
  - [] Example of running experiments with different configs

## 7. Documentation & Repository Updates
- [x] **7.1 Updated README**
  - [x] Instructions for all new tools and processes
  - [x] All scripts and configs included in repo
